# Tiacxy 3D Printer

This site is for general research notes and draft guides. The intention is for the actual build guide etc to be documented on a separate [book](https://github.com/ismangil/gitbook-build-3d-printer).

## Goal
A reliable 3D printer accurate enough to print 3D printer parts.
## Non-goal

* Cheap
* Blazing fast
* Large build space
## Heritage

Tiacxy is a remix of [Hypercube](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1752766) and [Hypercube 300](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2517628) design.

## Remixed bits

- Use some parts from HC300
- [24V supply](https://github.com/ismangil/tiacxy-3dprinter/wiki/24V-DC-system)
- [Controller board](https://github.com/ismangil/tiacxy-3dprinter/wiki/Controller-board) capable of 24V
- Increased height for electronics storage at bottom & filament spool/extruder on top
- X axis rods are 8mm steel rods with LM8LUU bearings, same as Y axis
