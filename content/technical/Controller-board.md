# Controller board

## 8-bit vs 32-bit

Tiacxy 1 will use an 8-bit controller, it is a tried and tested technology, with easy to source parts from multiple suppliers.

### 32-bit Upgrade path

It will be easy to swap out the controller board with a 32-bit board in the future, especially as Tiacxy is already 24V. All mechanics and power supply is not affected by 32-bit upgrade.

## Choice of 8-bit boards
 * Rumba
 * MKS
   * MKS 1.4
   * MKS 1.5
