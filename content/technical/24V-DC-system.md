By upgrading the original Hypercube to 24V, adjustments needed:

* Controller board capable of supplied by 24V
* Cables from 24V/350W/14.6A power supply to controller board: the max 15A should never be achieved, since there is an 11A fuse on the controller board. Using eBay/recyclestar tables 11A requires 0.5mm2 cables.
* 24V heated bed
* 24V hotend (+fan)
* 24V part cooling fan
* 24V controller cooling fan
